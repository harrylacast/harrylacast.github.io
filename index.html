        <p>Hi! My name is Harry LaCast and I am a third-year student at Northeastern University. I am originally
            from Dallas, Texas (where it is much warmer) and after starting out as a Computer Science major I am
            now a Data Science and Business Administration major. Some of my hobbies include listening and making
            music as well as climbing. This is a picture of me in Urbana, Illinois:
        </p>

        <p>Here is a list of things I want to add to this website in the future:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A link that links to some of my projects and maybe my Resume</li>
            <li>A button that allows you to play an audio of my cat meowing</li>
            <li>More pictures of me and my cat</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I hope to implement these features someday!</p>
