        <h1>LONG CAT</h1>
        <img src="images\long cat grass.jpg" alt="A long cat that is laying down in the grass" /> 
        <p>I want my website to center around cats. I want to mainly detail the differences between outdoor and indoor cats, 
            as well as the physical features of different kinds of cats. 
            I want the website to look fairly simple, so Iâ€™ll do a white or off-white background color. 
            The font can be more cartoony. I also want to include as many different kinds of cats as possible to emphasize the variety of 
            different housecats there are, 
            as well as just show off some cute animals.</p>

        <p>There are different types of cats:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>LONG</li>
            <li>SHORT</li>
            <li>WEIRD</li>
        </ul>
        <p>and all of them are sick!</p>
